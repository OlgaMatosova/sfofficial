                    keeping in mind that you require flexibility and continuous changes and advancements in the
                    project. Adding to this, we follow a sorted project management process based on a daily/weekly
                    reporting system, without any complexity. We charge the client based on the number of hours
                    dedicated by each resource.</p>

                <h3>Milestone Billing</h3>
                <p>We recommend this option for complex long-lasting projects with clearly identified phases where
                    either time- or milestone-based payment schedules are preferred. As each and every milestone is
                    properly accomplished, the client is expensed either a portion of the whole project expense or
                    simply a pre-defined sum decided upon ahead of the project. This model provides for better progress
                    monitoring and reduces risks associated with large-scale software endeavors.</p>
