                <p>This model is well suited to clients who have well-structured process to gather requirements,
                    scope, deliverable and acceptance criteria for the project. As you provide to us a clear idea,

                <h3>Time and&nbsp;Material</h3>
                <p>This is used when the resources and time can’t be estimated upfront, at the start. For a project
                    that has a constantly-evolving scope and constantly-changing requirements, our Time &amp;
                    Material model is perfect. It's a great agile model that’s the best fit for iterative and
                    incremental application development. We take your input and considerations at each stage
                    keeping in mind that you require flexibility and continuous changes and advancements in the
                    project. Adding to this, we follow a sorted project management process based on a daily/weekly
                    reporting system, without any complexity. We charge the client based on the number of hours
                    dedicated by each resource.</p>

                <h3>MILESTONE BILLING</h3>
                <p>We recommend this option for complex long-lasting projects with clearly identified phases where
                    either time- or milestone-based payment schedules are preferred. As each and every milestone is
                    properly accomplished, the client is expensed either a portion of the whole project expense or
                    simply a pre-defined sum decided upon ahead of the project. This model provides for better progress
                    monitoring and reduces risks associated with large-scale software endeavors.</p>
